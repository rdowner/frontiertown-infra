Frontier Town Infrastructure
============================

This repository contains the scripts, configuration and tooling that I use to
control my infrastructure, both on my workstations/laptops, and servers (mostly
colocated/cloud-located). This includes Ansible playbooks and roles, AWS
CloudFormation templates, and other items.

It is provided on the basis that some may find it useful or interesting, but is
offered WITHOUT WARRANTY. I have attempted to make tooling that is secure and
works as described, but you should exercise due diligence and review before
deploying anything found here in your own environments.

Secrets such as passwords and API keys are not present in this repository.
